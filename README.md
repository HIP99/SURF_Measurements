# How to use

SURF_Data.py can retrieve the data from all SURFS from one triggers pkl file

For an individual Channel use SURF_Channel.py. A SURF name such as "AV1" or SURF index system input, SURF 5, Channel 2 will need to be used. This will give you the data for that channel only

May or may not have been written yet but SURF_Unit.py will give the data for all the channels for a single SURF unit

SURF offset it specifically for centering pulses
